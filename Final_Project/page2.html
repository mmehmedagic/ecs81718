            I started school when I was four years old in Pre-K level at Thomas J. Waters Elementary School. I got A's (for the most part, some B's, :P) in all of my subjects. My favorite subject was most definitely math, and in 4th grade, I decided to put extra
            effort into learning more math. In 6th grade, the administartion of Waters put me in a higher level (I didn't ask for it), so I've been highly accomplished/ahead ever since. Living in the same house in Chicago my entire life, I had the ability
            to never transfer schools until high school. However, in 6th grade, I tried out for Lane Tech Academic Center and made it in, so I accepted, packed up all my bags, and said goodbye to all my friends (until I saw them after school every day
            next year). I've been in Lane Tech ever since and yet I am still ahead in math weirdly enough. I plan on staying here for the rest of high school, unless something major happens.

            At Waters, I attended the Chess Club (for 4 or 5 years) and the Math Team (for 1 year). We went to various competitions and tournaments, but I never won anything. In my 6th grade year, the Math Team for Waters took a pause, so I was sad that I wasn't
            able to compete my final year there. However, when I went to Lane Tech, they had a Math Team, and I immeditely joined. I was placed in the top 6 of the 7th grade team, meaning I contributed to the team's overall scores. Throughout my 7th grade
            year, I won one silver and two gold medals for individuals and three gold for the team. In 8th grade now, I continue to participate in the LTAC Math Team, but I also joined Science Olympiad. So far in the is school year, I won two silver individual
            medals for Math Team, two gold team medals for Math Team, and two gold medals for Science Olympiad.
